					<p class="sectioncontentleft">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first pen and one of the most expensive I will own at any given point in time. There is a long winded history with this pen specifically. I had bought this from Goulet Pen Company as LE#42 which is funny because the number 42 is the meaning of life. Incidentally, it was the very last pen of this trim in any nib size they had in stock. Unfortunately, the Ruthenium plating had worn off on the cap. Visconti's certified service and warranty center, Coles of London, happily warrantied it and replaced it with LE#25. What's funny about that number is that I had originally purchased the pen as an early 25th birthday present to myself. As such, the pen has a special meaning to me.
					<p class="sectioncontentleft">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pen itself is very nicely weighted and balances nicely without being posted. Posted, I find it to be rather unwieldy and cumbersome. Maybe it's a different experience for other people. Writingwise, I have been told by many people that Visconti does not do much if anything in the way of tuning or adjusting the nib at all. However, I have found that this Medium writes rather smoothly. It does have a good deal of feedback, but not in a bad way. It lets me know about the surface of the paper I am writing on. If anything, I would prefer this to just a smooth frictionless and numb slide. While people may prefer less feedback, I think this kind of feeback gives it character. Note, however, that the nib does not scratch the paper itself. It simply reflects the surface of the paper to the writer.
					<p class="sectioncontentleft">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do find myself watching the ink dry sometimes as this nib appears to be very wet. Your mileage may vary depending on your specific nib and ink. Perhaps it is important to note that the nib is very wet but not simply dumping ink onto the page indiscriminately. I can write fairly quickly and briskly and the nib will not skip or railroad unless the first reservoir has run out of ink. There is no worry about whether or not the pen can keep up with any sort of writing at all. The gold nib provides a bit of spring and flex to the experience.
					<p class="sectioncontentleft">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I really enjoy the pen and how it writes. I don't know if it justifies the $2000 cost, or any pen more than $100, beyond the cost of raw materials, but the artistic value and writing experience combined with the meaning of this specific instrument being #25 makes it worth it to me. This might be one of the most expensive if not the most expensive pen I ever acquire, unless I just win a massive lottery.
